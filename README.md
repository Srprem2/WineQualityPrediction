# WineQualityPrediction
This Python script analyzes a wine dataset, cleans missing values, visualizes quality distribution, filters good-quality wines, explores correlations, and transforms the target variable. It then standardizes features, splits data, and trains Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, evaluating their performance with classification metrics.
